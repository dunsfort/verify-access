# Access Verification QR Codes

This repository hosts QR codes used for verifying participants' access at secure entry points.

## 🔒 How it works

1. Each QR code corresponds to a participant and links to an image or profile stored in this GitHub Pages site.
2. Security personnel scan the QR code on a printed card.
3. The scanned code opens a page (like `https://dunsfort.github.io/verify-access/verify/faae4268e5.png`) showing the person's image and credentials.

## 📂 File Structure
